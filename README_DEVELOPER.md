## Releasing a new version of ariac2 Docker images.

1. Build the base Docker images.

The most recent version of packages will be installed from `apt`.
Packages installed from `apt` include:
1. `ariac2`
1. `gazebo8`
1. ROS packages except those in `gazebo_ros_pkgs`

The `gazebo_ros_pkgs` metapackage is built from source using [this branch specific to ARIAC](https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/tree/ariac-network-kinetic).

```
./prepare_ariac_system.bash kinetic
```

1. Test using local images.

Replace references to `ariac/ariac2-*:latest` images with the local image name, where images are being used for (1) building team images and (2) running trials.

That is:
- `ariac/ariac2-competitor-base-${ROS_DISTRO_BUILD_TIME}:latest` -> `ariac-competitor-base-${ROS_DISTRO_BUILD_TIME}` in `ariac-competitior/build_competitor_image.bash`
- `ariac/ariac2-server-${ROS_DISTRO}:latest` -> `ariac-server-${ROS_DISTRO}` in `run_trial.bash`

```
./prepare_team_system.bash example_team
./run_trial.bash example_team sample
```

Confirm the ARIAC version running in the container is correct:
```
docker exec -it ariac-server-system /bin/bash
dpkg -s ariac2
```

1. Push the images to Dockerhub.

Configure Dockerhub credentials, then:

```
./push_dockerhub_images.bash <ariac_version> <gazebo_version
# e.g.:
# ./push_dockerhub_images.bash ariac2.1.4 gazebo_8.4
```

This will also update the `lastest` tag on Dockerhub images.


## Running the competition.

1. Fetch the latest Docker images.

Unless you're on the same computer that created the most recent `ariac2` Docker images, fetch them from Dockerhub.

```
./pull_dockerhub_imges.bash
```

1. Download team systems.

Create a directory for each team in `team_config` and place their system's files in it, following the layout in `team_config/example_team`.

1. Prepare Docker images for all team systems.

```
./prepare_all_team_systems.bash
```

1. Download the trial config files.

All trial config files found in the `trial_config` directory will be used.
Ensure that `gazebo_state_logging: true` is in the options of the config files.

1. Run all trials for all teams.

```
./run_all_trials.bash
```

This will output results to the `logs` directory with the following structure:

```
logs
└── example_team  # team name
    └── sample  # trial name
        ├── gazebo
        │   └── state.log  # gazebo state log file
        ├── generated  # the specific files generated by gear.py based on team/trial config files
        │   ├── gear.launch
        │   ├── gear.urdf.xacro
        │   └── gear.world
        ├── performance.log  # scoring log file
        ├── ros  # ROS logs copied from ARIAC server container
        │   └── rosout.log
        └── ros-competitor  # ROS logs copied from competitor container
            └── example_node-1-stdout.log
```

1. Generate videos from Gazebo state logs.

```
./run_all_team_videos.bash
```

This will add a `video` directory to each trial found in the `logs` directory with a screen capture of the state log playback, e.g.:

```
logs
└── example_team
    └── sample
        ├── gazebo
        ├── generated
        ├── performance.log
        ├── ros
        ├── ros-competitor
        └── video
            └── example_team_sample.ogv
```

1. Re-running trials.

Before re-running any trials, copy the `logs` directory to one with another name.

All trials can be re-run for a single team using `./run_all_trials.bash example_team`.

All trials can be re-run for a set of teams by using `./run_all_teams.bash` after editing the `LIST_OF_TEAMS` variable in `run_all_teams.bash`.

A single trial can be re-run for all teams using `./run_all_teams.bash` after editing the `LIST_OF_TRIALS` variable in `run_all_trials.bash`.
